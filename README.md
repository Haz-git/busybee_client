# GymJot (Client-Side/Front-End)

A *powerlifting-focused* web-app designed for tracking weight statistics and creating custom weightlifting programs.

- This repository houses the client-side of my web application *GymJot*. As such, most of the details mentioned here are largely front-end related. If you want to learn more about my API, please visit [GymJot's server-side repository](https://github.com/Haz-git/GymJot-Server)!

### About The Project

*GymJot* was developed to improve the workflow of one of my most favorite hobbies-- powerlifting. Normally, I'd create my powerlifting training
regiments on something like *Excel* or *Google Drive*, and then take a picture of the spreadsheet to carry to the gym. Then, all my weightlifting statistics
are simply stored in the *Notes* app on my iphone. Taking multiple pictures of my main exercises for the week and fervently searching through a long list of weight records was clunky and unappealing.

I decided to leverage my development skills to create my own progressive web-app (PWA) to solve my issue. With *GymJot*, I can store all my stats + create and run my custom workout routines on the same app!

#### Built With
- Html
- Css
- ReactJS
- React-Redux + Redux
- Styled-Components
